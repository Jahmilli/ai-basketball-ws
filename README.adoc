```
docker run -p 9000:9000 minio/minio server /data
```

To view a Minio Dashboard, go to: http://127.0.0.1:9000/
. Username: minioadmin
. Password: minioadmin

=== Run Postgres Locally

```
docker run --rm -itd --name aibasketball-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -e POSTGRES_DB=mydb -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

=== Local development
